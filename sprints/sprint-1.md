## :heavy_check_mark: Deliveries
 
### :heavy_check_mark: RF 01: API construction that will fetch the files that must be sent to the Cloud (MVP)

We created the API that transfers files from Google Drive to AWS S3 automatically, the application queries new files every 1 minute.

### :heavy_check_mark: RF 04: Create downloaded file history screen
    
#### ðŸ”Ž Home Screen

Upon entering, the user is directed to the home screen, with buttons that will forward to other functions of the system.

#### ðŸ”Ž File Menu

On this screen, the user will be able to access the list of files through the button, in the future the dashboard for data analysis will be implemented.

#### ðŸ”Ž File Listing (Transfer History)

We made a history of the files transferred to AWS S3, through the listing, the user will be able to view the metadata of the files that were transferred in real time.

### :heavy_check_mark: RF 04: Wireframe (Prototype in Figma)
    
To extract and understand the customer's wishes, an initial prototype was built in Figma, creating the visual identity and design of the system, the layout was validated by the customer.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Burndown

In order to make better use of each member's skills, the team was separated into two fronts: frontend and backend, where, in the first sprint, the frontend team was responsible for making the prototype, frontend design and integration of features while the team the backend was responsible for creating the necessary services and identifying the metadata that will be stored in the dashboard in the future.

- The monitoring of activities, the responsibility of the Scrum Master, is shown in the image below, which contains the Burndown chart generated by the team (where the X axis is the days worked in the sprint and the Y axis values represent the deliveries and efforts made with the passage of time), including the activities carried out and those responsible for them.
