We have a challenge to implement the service configuration interface, which will allow the user to configure the necessary parameters for the service to work properly.
    
<span id="goals">
    
## :dart: Sprint Goals
The requirements (both customer and educational institution) covered for third sprint are:
- **RF 07:** Create screen for system configuration (application for service configuration and parameterization)
- **RF 08:** Monitoring system and data health through Grafana
- **RF 09:** Issue an alert in the OS warning that new files have been downloaded
- **RNF 14:** Front-end layout improvements (Home Screen and Sidebar)
- **RNF 15:** File transfer status
- **RF 16:** Scan time (how often the system checks for new files)

### :heavy_check_mark: RF 07/RF 16: Create screen for system configuration (application for service configuration and parameterization)    
The configuration screen allows the user to specify the necessary parameters for the download process, such as the video platform, the destination cloud, authentication credentials, file types to be downloaded, update frequency, among others.

With a configuration screen, the user can customize the service to their specific needs and ensure that it is running optimally. This increases the efficiency of the service and ensures that it is meeting user expectations. In addition, the configuration screen also allows the user to adjust the service parameters as their needs change, which ensures the flexibility of the system.     
     
The user can define:

- The API check hours and minutes for transfer
- Configure drive and azure directories in process

### :heavy_check_mark: RF 08: Monitoring system and data health through Grafana
  
ðŸ“Š In this sprint we used Grafana to create the reports, Grafana is a data visualization and monitoring platform that can be integrated with multiple data sources including databases, infrastructure monitoring systems, cloud services and more.
     
Now the user can view the metrics as below:

- CPU usage
- Deadlocks
- BD Connections - Success
- BD Connections - Failure (System Errors)
- BD Connections - Failure (Users Errors)

### :heavy_check_mark: RF 09: Issue an alert in the OS warning that new files have been downloaded 
     
ðŸ”‹ We have made the alert in the operating system (OS) to ensure that the process of downloading transferred files is done reliably and efficiently. This allows the user to take the necessary steps to correct any issues in the process and ensure that the download completes.
     
### :heavy_check_mark: RF 14: Front-end layout improvements (Home Screen and Sidebar)
     
Improving the layout can improve the efficiency of the system, making it easier for the user to navigate and use the service. A clear, uncluttered user interface allows the user to easily find the information they need and perform tasks faster. This increases user productivity and reduces the possibility of errors or frustration.     
     
- Updated Home Screen âœ¨

We also made improvements to the layout of other screens, as below:    
     
- Drive and Azure Modals ðŸ’«
